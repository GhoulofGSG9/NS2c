Download and rename (if you want) to NS2c, run StartMod.bat from anywhere.


Optionally you can place in your 'natural selection 2' folder 
(next to ns2 NOT inside it)
and create a shortcut to Ns2.exe 
with the -game ns2c parameter, which will start the mod.



For Servers
add -mods 5f3b1e6 to your server command line variables, and rename the ns2c folder to
m5f3b1e6_1348965408.  Then place that folder in the location set with the -modstorage command
line argument.
